IMPORTENT: I did not have enough time to finish the stats part of the assignment so i printed what each window looked like every round
to show that everything works correctly. I am fairly confident everything works correctly, I just ran out of time to do the stats.

For this project I talked with Clarrese but I didn't use any of her code.
